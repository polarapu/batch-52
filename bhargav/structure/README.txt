WELCOME
=======


Congratulations, you have just created a new Mule project!

This wizard created a number of new classes and resources useful for new Mule
projects.  Each of the created files contains documentation and _todo_ items
where necessary.  Here is an overview of what was created.

./pom.xml:

A maven project descriptor that describes how to build this project.

.src/main/app/mule-config.xml:

A basic configuration to get you started.

.src/main/app/mule-deploy.properties:

A basic deployment descriptor that controls how the application should be deployed.
Here you can specify things like the encoding to use, or which domain the app belongs to.
For more information see: https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Mule+Application+Deployment+Descriptor

TESTING
=======

This project also contains test classes that can be run as part of a test suite.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
./src/test/java/1/ExampleFunctionalTestCase.java

This is an example functional test case.  The test will work as is, but you
need to configure it to actually test your code.
For more information about
testing see: https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Functional+Testing.
